"""Create the active_req_blocks table.

Terminology:
  A dap_req_block is a Degree Works "Degree Audit Process REQuirement BLOCK" which includes the
  Scribe code that specifies a set of requirements, along with attributes (metadata) to identify
  the block (requirement_id, block_type, block_value and range of academic years, for example)

  Current blocks are in dap_req_block (local table name is requirement_blocks) with a
  period_stop attribute that starts with '9', meaning they are in effect for the current
  academic year.

  Active blocks are dap_req_blocks for degrees, majors, minors, concentrations, and some other
  types of block (other and libl) for which students who are currently in attendance at the
  college and are registered for the program. OAREDA provides an daily update of these blocks,
  including their enrollment sizes, for each term the block was active.

  Programs includes both :
    - academic plans (dap_req_block type is MAJOR or MINOR)
    - academic subplans (dap_req_block type is CONC)
